Small demo sample of how to compile an archive into a C executable

- Set the include path (to find the headers with the function declarations)
- Set the library path (to find the binary executable implementations of the functions)

- Just mimick what's going on in the Makefile, it really does capture the essence of how
  compiling a static library with a source file into a binary executable works
