This foler, 'purgatory', will be where I store old files that I will probably never use any more.
However, I put a lot of work in to them so I'm saving them to see if I can recycle any of the code
or be reminded of any old thought processes or ideas I have.

I'll delete them when I'm sure I don't want / need to deal with any of the information left in them,
but until then, this folder will house old, soon-to-be-removed files just in case any information can/should
be harvested on their way out, or if there's some unforeseen situation where I need to re-integrate it into
the larger project, either entirely unchanged, with some modifications to fit the new landscape, or just gutted
and parts of code copied, pasted, and smeared into the rest of the new existing code base.


**Don't be flippant about deleting files in here. They're here because they're still useful, so save them
  for as long as possible until you're sure that they're just useless and some other old data that you're
  keeping track of.
