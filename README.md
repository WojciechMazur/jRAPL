# jRAPL
If you stumbled upon this repo, feel free to use whatever you want out of it, but the documentation is definitely not guaranteed to be accurate. The energy reading utilities from Java work but you kind of have to figure out what to use and how it works :)

Repo for Alejandro and Rutvik to collaborate on the jRAPL project (version 2.0)

Based on jRAPL files originally obtained from Kenan Liu's original jRAPL project: https://github.com/kliu20/jRAPL

See his README for general information about jRAPL, although some implementation details differ for this version
