Talk about next meeting:
	I came up with more plot presentation methods after we talked, so I applied them. Mostly colors and axis scales and whatnot

really big error bars on one of the plots which makes them unreadable. how do you deal with this situation?

should joules / power per sample be combined sockets, or broken down by sockets?
	in general, comined sockets / overall system (but still broken down by power domain) is a common thing, right?

should average power be "power per sample" or 


overview of framework -- just like how the whole tool works, right
	asyncenergymonitor cside / javaside design pattern
