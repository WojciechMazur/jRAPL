here is a closer look at the normalized sample interval under the new smapling rates
	i want to look at what it's like with a sampling rate of 8, so ill make that go this week

theres a bit more restructuring of how i store and process the data to manage different sampling rates,
so coming up with plots took longer than i thought this week. i'll have it on overleaf by the end of the day though



Also, Prof Liu, did you say that you could handle "Section 1" Type stuff? I'm happy to let you do that, since you probably have more contextual
knowledge about how jRAPL plays in to this whole area of energy aware computing than I do.



Not necessary to bring up for a while
    - when we get the the thing about contributors, will Rutvik count? He helped quite a bit when he was actively involved, and I've also talked to him about what to do in some situations, even after he stopped.
