change timing stuff to store in an array and print later
DaCapo benchmarks. find out how the benchmarks work --  Rutvik
keep making the document good. work on formatting
standardize file naming conventions -- make scripts always ask for name as arg so they can name all your output
run all of the benchmarks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

migt want to get the copy-to-string thing to work as one function

find out if it's OK to 'modprobe msr' every single time you run or if 
  it's better and also not a waste of time to first check if it's
  installed and then do it and blah blah

at some point check to make sure that the package-->uncore math is good to do on C side or Java side
	(probably better on java side so we also have the package reading available in the array that the java function returns...)


***Script stuff***
pass in identifier name thru $1							--alej
make sure the script validates that identifier is passed thru $1		--alej
combine java and c data scripts to one that gets options to do c or java data	--rutvik
wrapper function to gather java and c data to make the compariosn graphs	--rutvik
generalize bar graph comparison (change name to bar_graph_comparisons.py)	--rutvik
latex figure generator								--alej
