 ------------------------------ Higher Priority ------------------------------
make sure all the benchmarks work (all programs installed)				--probably easy
timer implementation on java and C side (get energy readings ever x milliseconds)
make the overleaf document better
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
use pthread.join()
look up channel passing
make C side do numbers instead of string to gather energy readings
make data collection collect datasets and display graphs with outliers removed via TwoSD or Grubbs Test
make sure you're consistent with Socket Naming Convention -- 0 indexed or 1 indexed?

--what if TimingUtils just calls and times the functions instead of having this inbred embedding of time stamps that involves logging across two files with macros and data structures..........duh **laughing emoji**

get copy-to-string thing to work as one function (i think if we pass in the entire 2-D array it'll work fine)

find out if it's OK to 'modprobe msr' every single time you run or if 
  it's better and also not a waste of time to first check if it's
  installed and then do it and blah blah

at some point check to make sure that the package-->uncore math is good to do on C side or Java side
	(probably better on java side so we also have the package reading available in the array that the java function returns...)
