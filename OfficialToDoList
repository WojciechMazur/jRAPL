 ------------------------------ Higher Priority ------------------------------
keep making the document good. work on formatting
make sure all the benchmarks work (all programs installed)				--probably easy
timer implementation on java and C side (get energy readings ever x milliseconds)
email khaled: 'can you send the source code behind the script you sent?'		--probably easy
make the overleaf document better
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

get copy-to-string thing to work as one function (i think if we pass in the entire 2-D array it'll work fine)

find out if it's OK to 'modprobe msr' every single time you run or if 
  it's better and also not a waste of time to first check if it's
  installed and then do it and blah blah

at some point check to make sure that the package-->uncore math is good to do on C side or Java side
	(probably better on java side so we also have the package reading available in the array that the java function returns...)
