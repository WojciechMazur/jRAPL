<< Immediate Todos:
	Update the paper with all experiment data by tonight
	Redo the memory experiments but once you un-implement the SocketNum field per struct

<< Semi Immediate Todos:
	Do experiments on dynamically choosing the size of the LinkNodes

<< Other Todos:
	Update the UML

"timer" implemntation on the C side -- could make the sleep_milliseconds() function more accurate

Ideas for future development:
	- Make C run on a schedule instead of sleeping, so sampling overhead of 130-170usec (on jolteon, at least) isn't an issue for high rates.
		- See timer implementation, or the thing Timur sent: https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler/blob/master/src/itimer.cpp

	- Make the AsyncMonitor have an 'auto dump' file, then have it dump its content to file (on a separate thread) and clear out.
		To make it not indefinitely grow in memory
	- AsyncMonitor runs a set number of samples at a rate, instead of a start/stop wait loop
