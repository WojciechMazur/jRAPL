<< Have done by next week ## wednesday #:
	JMH tests on Native vs Java
	JMH tests on MSR reading
	Run the tests on a Jolteon or whatever the other server is called (ask Timur for access)
	Python parsing and graphing
	Update the above to to Overleaf
	Organize code for AsyncEnergyMonitor (and also C side and Java side) so it can be clearly presented on Overleaf
	Update the UML
	Implement the small 'jRAPL improvements' that you came up with during the hackathon
	Do a pass on Overleaf document to make sure everything is in shape
	EnergyManager.active boolean variable, so as to prevent double init()s or double dealloc()s

Make sure Java code is neat, since we're pretty much done refactoring the core utilities, so it's important for it to be legible for presenting it

add another info thing youre tracking for 'number of microseconds between nonzero readings'
  and make that a third plot for each dram/core/gpu/pkg (again, best to do it all in one fig
  of 4 subplots)

run thread experiments with 5 and 10 and 20 ms delay

Compare # of samples between C and Java

time between nonzero readings as a test that gets evaluated (based off of timestamps)

make the AsyncMonitor run a set number of operations   instead of start/stop wait loop
make the AsyncMonitor run a set number of milliseconds instead of start/stop wait loop

"timer" implemntation on the C side
