- started with a log of all of the output from the parsing script
- grepped for instances of negative diff reported, matching 5 lines above and below as well
    - this is to include filenames of files with normal bahviour, so i'd be able to look at them and be able
      to compare what normal and weird energy plots would look like
- manually went through the files and deleted sections (grep delimited the sections 5 lines above and below the match with --)
  that had the normal expected wraparound behaviour
    - would've probably worked to write a script to do that...very doable because of the -- delimiter
- used vim commands to isolate the file names and deleted the rest of the text

- commands I did to get the rest were something like this (appended my bash history to this file, picked out the relevant commands, and rewrote a bit to make it more concise / presentable)

for x in $(cat files-to-pull.txt | sort | uniq)
do
    echo System{A,B}/samplingrate_{1,2,4}/$x # i lost the information about which anomaly files belong to which sys/samplingrate, so im copying all and i'll figure out which they were with my eyes
done \
    | sed 's/\ /\n/g' | sort \
    > tmp
sed -i "s|^|alejalej@vaporeon.cs.binghamton.edu:/home/alejalej/storage/async-monitor-experiments/|" tmp 
mv tmp files-to-pull.txt 

mkdir -p pulled-files/System{A,B}/samplingrate_{1,2,4} # files copied will just be the file names, so i have to direct them into the proper folder. i cant just copy a subset of the directory tree, so i have to build the directory tree myself

# these functions extract the system name and sampling rate, so I can build the destination file path and know where to write copied files to
function sys() {
    echo $1 | grep -o 'System[AB]'
}
function sr() {
    echo $1 | grep -o 'samplingrate_[124]'
}

for file in $(cat files-to-pull.txt); do
    scp $file pulled-files/$(sys $file)/$(sr $file)/
done
