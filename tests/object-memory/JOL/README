Using Java Object Layout (JOL) tool provided by OpenJDK https://github.com/openjdk/jol

Source saying 'java object has a 12 byte header, and object sizes are padded out to
a multiple of 8': https://www.baeldung.com/java-size-of-object


This version is deprecated and inaccurate, since its just a topical layout, not a deep
look. Also pretty sure it only works for class types, you can't pass in an array and
get accurate results. Also doesn't work on live objects, it just looks like it scans the
class definition and adds up stuff, and also does the padding calculations.
