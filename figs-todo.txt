figures dont need titles

capitalize first letters

report units -> report dimensions

eergy update time
	remove xticks on energy update time
		elapsed time from start as x axis
	y axis as ms
	dots w/ borders, ply with alpha value
	average figure is unnecessary

histograms
	y axis: number of calls
	x axis: time (us)
	less digits in the legend
	cside and javaside next to each other (subplot)
	emphasize the order of magniutde difference somehow
	normalize the bars
	
	for MSR ones: 'runtime to read individual components'
		plot them all on one line
		maybe normalize it when theyre all together
		consider making a table instead of plots
		maybe dont include CORE?
		
whole sample runtime
	just say the number, not a figure
	
do power for per becnhmark (time normalize those boys)
