report units -> report dimensions

histograms
	normalize the bars (maybe not tho)
	for MSR ones: 'runtime to read individual components'
		plot them all on one line
		maybe normalize it when theyre all together
		maybe dont include CORE?

whole sample runtime
	just say the number, not a figure
	
do power for per becnhmark (time normalize those boys)

to colorize (dont spend more than 20 minutes total, these just have to get done):
	()syncmonitor sampling runtime
	sampling efficiency
	()time per sample
	()energy per sample
	()power per sample

	remember to run the graphs on vaporeon once you get the colors right
