report units -> report dimensions

histograms
	normalize the bars (maybe not tho)
	for MSR ones: 'runtime to read individual components'
		plot them all on one line
		maybe normalize it when theyre all together
		maybe dont include CORE?

whole sample runtime
	just say the number, not a figure
	
do time_normalize for per becnhmark energy samples


put horizontal lines on sampling efficiency, see how that looks
to resize:
	- time between samples
	- memory footprint
	- sampling efficiency
