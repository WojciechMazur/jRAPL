report units -> report dimensions

histograms
	normalize the bars (maybe not tho)

	for MSR ones: 'runtime to read individual components'
		plot them all on one line
		maybe normalize it when theyre all together
		consider making a table instead of plots
		maybe dont include CORE?

whole sample runtime
	just say the number, not a figure
	
do power for per becnhmark (time normalize those boys)
